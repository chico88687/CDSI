Conceção e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas de Informação

A Website created using the OpenXava tool. The purpose of the website was to help clients simulate bank credits based on several different factors like the client’s income or other loans the client might have. A database was developed on Modelio and implemented in SQL and was later used on the OpenXava project itself.
